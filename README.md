# Project overview

This repository hosts `CAL.cf`, a labelled BNF grammar file defining
syntax of the CAL actor programming language. It is based on Annex D
of the Internation Standard ISO/IEC 23001-4, *Information technology â€”
MPEG systems technologies - Part 4: Codec configuration representation
3rd edition*, with modifications to conform to expectations of the CAL
frontend of the Orcc compiler.

# Compiling to and from CAL in a source-to-source compiler

The `CAL.cf` file is in the correct format for the `BNFC` software,
which is a frontend generator for C, C++, C#, Haskell, Java, and
OCaml. BNFC generates components in these langauges, to use CAL as a
frontend or a backend in a source to source compiler. The `bnfc`
executable generates:

* an abstract syntax implementation
* a case skeleton for the abstract syntax in the same language
* an Alex, JLex, or Flex lexer generator file
* a Happy, CUP, or Bison parser generator file
* a pretty-printer as a Haskell/Java/C++/C module
* a Latex file containing a readable specification of the language

The source files generated by `bnfc` enables either the parsing of a
CAL file into an AST, or the pretty-printing of an AST to CAL syntax
as a string which can then be written to a `.cal` file. This is shown
here:

# Example: generating a CAL actor via Haskell

The following example shows how to create a `.cal` file for a simple
CAL actor. First, we create our compiler components:

    bnfc -m --haskell CAL.cf

Then we can programmatically construct a CAL actor using data type
constructors to construct an AST for the actor. We can then use the
`printTree` to create a string we can write to a `.cal` file:

```
module Main where

import qualified LexCAL as C
import qualified ParCAL as C
import qualified SkelCAL as C
import qualified PrintCAL as C
import qualified AbsCAL as C

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let actorCode = C.printTree actor
    writeFile "my_actor.cal" actorCode

actor :: C.Actor
actor = actorAST
    where
      actorAST      = C.Actr (C.PathN [C.PNameCons (C.Ident "cal")]) imports (C.Ident "my_actor") actorPar ioSig varDecl [action] priorityBlock
      priorityBlock = []
      actorPar      = []
      imports       = []
      varDecl       = [ C.VDecl inType  (C.Ident "i") [] ]
      ioSig         = C.IOSg [C.PortDcl (intCalType 8) (C.Ident "In")] [C.PortDcl (intCalType 8) (C.Ident "Out")]
      inType        = C.TypParam C.TUint [C.TypeAttrSizeDf (C.LitExpCons (C.IntLitExpr (C.IntegerLit 8)))]
      outType       = C.TypParam C.TUint [C.TypeAttrSizeDf (C.LitExpCons (C.IntLitExpr (C.IntegerLit 8)))]
      inputPattern  = [ C.InPattTagIds (C.Ident "In") [(C.Ident "x")] ]
      outputPattern = [ C.OutPattTagIds (C.Ident "Out") [(C.Ident "i")] ]
      actionHead    = C.ActnHead inputPattern outputPattern
      action        = C.AnActn (C.ActnTagsStmts (C.ActnTagDecl [C.Ident "the_action"]) actionHead stmts)
      stmts         = [ C.SemiColonSeparatedStmt (C.AssignStt (C.AssStmt (C.Ident "i") (C.BEAdd (C.EIdent (C.Ident "i")) (C.EIdent (C.Ident "x"))))) ]
      intCalType i  = C.TypParam C.TUint [C.TypeAttrSizeDf (C.LitExpCons (C.IntLitExpr (C.IntegerLit i)))]
```

Compiling and running this Haskell program generates the
following `my_actor.cal` file:

```
package cal ;
actor my_actor () uint (size = 8)In ==> uint (size = 8)Out :
 uint (size = 8) i;
   the_action : action In : [x]==> Out : [i]
     do i := i + x ;
   end
end
```

# CAL syntax as a Haskell library

This repository also exposes a cabal project called `cal-src` for
compiler related Haskell projects that wish to use CAL as either a
frontend or a backend. Once in the repository, simply run:

    $ cabal install

Once you add `cal-src` as a build depdendency in your cabal-ised
project, you should be able to import all relevant modules, i.e.

```
import qualified LexCAL as C
import qualified ParCAL as C
import qualified SkelCAL as C
import qualified PrintCAL as C
import qualified AbsCAL as C
```
